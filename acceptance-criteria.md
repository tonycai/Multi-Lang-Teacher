This `acceptance-criteria.md` document provides a detailed set of conditions that need to be met for each user story to be considered complete and successful. These criteria will guide the development and testing efforts for the Multi-Lang-Teacher project. Remember to refine and add more specific criteria as your understanding of the requirements evolves.
